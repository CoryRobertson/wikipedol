# Wikipedol
This is flat out some of the worst code I have written. It functions mostly ok, but uses all of the bad features of javascript in my opinion. Functionally the game is kinda fun though!
### How the game works
The game will choose 3 random wikipedia pages. When you click new hint, the game will now generate a new page, by crawling recursivly 6 pages deep from one of the given 3 pages. Your goal is to guess which page that new page came from. :)
